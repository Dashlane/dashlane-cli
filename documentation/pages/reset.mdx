# Reset local data

If you want to start fresh with the CLI or use another account, you can reset the local data by running the following command:

```sh
dcli reset
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    This does not perform an account reset, it only resets the local data on the device.
</Callout>

A confirmation will be asked, then the local database containing your encrypted data will be wiped and any entry related to the CLI will be removed from the OS keychain.
