# Backup your local Vault

By using the `backup` command, you can backup your local vault to a given directory and filename.
The command will perform a sync prior to the backup to ensure that the latest data is pulled from the Dashlane servers.

The backup is a [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database file containing all your secrets encrypted by your master password.

```sh copy filename="By default the backup file is stored in the current directory and named dashlane-backup-<timestamp>.db"
dcli backup
```

```sh copy filename="You can specify the directory and filename"
dcli backup --filename <filename> --directory <directory>
```

The database is composed of 3 tables:

-   `device`: contains the current device information and configuration (including your device secrets)
-   `transactions`: contains all the transactions that composed your vault (the type determines if the transaction is a password, a note, a credit card, etc.)
-   `syncUpdates`: contains the sync updates when the data was pulled from the Dashlane servers
