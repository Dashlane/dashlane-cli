# Managing your devices

## List your devices

```sh copy
dcli devices list
```

You'll get a list of all your devices, with their ID, name, and platform.

```sh
f6110572        Chrome - Linux    server_standalone       other
e96c8942        Firefox - Ubuntu  server_standalone       other
9d7fc86f        Chrome - Mac OS   server_standalone       other
61e815b5        Dashlane CLI      server_standalone       current
```

You can also request the result in JSON format:

```sh copy
dcli devices list --json
```

## Remove devices from your account

Devices that are removed from your account will need to re-authenticate to Dashlane again.
This is useful if you want to remove a device that you no longer use, or you don't have access to anymore.

### Remove specific devices

```sh copy
dcli devices remove <device-id-1> <device-id-2>
```

### Remove all devices except the current one

```sh copy
dcli devices remove --other
```

### Remove all devices including current CLI device

```sh copy
dcli devices remove --all
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    If you remove the current CLI device, you will need to do a `dcli reset` in order to re-authenticate.
