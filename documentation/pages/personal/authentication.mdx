# Authentication

To start with launch a first manual sync:

```sh copy
dcli sync
```

Authenticating to your personal vault requires your email.
You will be then asked to validate a second factor to register the CLI to your account.

    SSO authentication is not supported yet.
</Callout>

## Supported 2FA methods

-   Email code validation (default)
-   TOTP code validation (via an authenticator app)
-   DUO push notification

By completing the device registration process, you'll be now asked to enter your Master Password.

## Options

By default your Master Password will be saved locally in the OS keychain so you don't have to enter it every time.
You can disable this behavior with the following command:

```sh copy
dcli configure save-master-password false
```
