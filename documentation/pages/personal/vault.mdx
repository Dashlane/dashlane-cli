## Get a password

```sh
dcli p mywebsite
# will return any entry for which either the url or the title matches mywebsite

dcli p id=xxxxxx
# will return any entry for which the id matches xxxxxx

dcli p url=someurl title=mytitle
# will return any entry for which the url matches someurl, or the title matches mytitle

dcli p url,title=mywebsite
# will return any entry for which either the url or the title matches mywebsite
```

Note: You can select a different output for passwords among `clipboard, password, json`. The JSON option outputs all the matching credentials.

## Generate an OTP code

```sh copy
dcli otp [filters]
```

## Get a secure note

```sh copy
dcli note [titleFilter]
```

## Options

By default an automatic synchronization is performed once per hour.
You can change this behavior with the following command:

```sh copy
dcli configure disable-auto-sync true
```

## Use cases

### Use SSH Keys from your vault

This use case shows you how to use Dashlane to store your SSH keys and use them to connect to your servers.
This could be useful if you want to share SSH keys with your team.

Let's say you have generated a new SSH key pair and you want to store it in Dashlane.

```sh
# this is an example, use the parameters you want
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Dashlane SSH demo key"
```

Copy the private key to your clipboard and store it in a new secure note (named `SSH_DEMO_KEY` in our example) in Dashlane via the extension.
It is important to include the headers of the key (`-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`) in the secure note.

Now, make sure your CLI is synchronized:

```sh copy
dcli sync
```

Once done, you can retrieve the private key from your vault and inject it in your SSH agent:

```sh copy
dcli n SSH_DEMO_KEY | ssh-add -
```
