# Explore Dashlane Audit logs with AI Agents

<EnrolledDeviceCredentialsBanner />

Dashlane audit logs can be queried by local AI agents supporting the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

Learn more about Dashlane audit logs on [the audit logs documentation](/business/audit-logs)

## Prerequisites

As audit logs can be quite large, your agent should have access to a tool to explore large JSON files efficiently, such as `jq`.

You can install `jq` using your operating system package manager. See [jq download page](https://jqlang.org/download/) for detailed instructions for main operating systems.

## Example usage with Claude Code

To use the Dashlane audit log MCP server with Claude Code, add the MCP to Claude code this way:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport stdio dashlane -- dcli team mcp
```

or to embed the credentials in the MCP config:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport stdio dashlane --env DASHLANE_ENROLLED_TEAM_DEVICE_KEYS=DASH_EDWSA_... -- dcli team mcp
```

You may then ask questions such as "Make a summary of phishing attempts detected by Dashlane this month".
