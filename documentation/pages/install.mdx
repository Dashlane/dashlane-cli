    You can install the Dashlane CLI using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager for macOS. To install Homebrew, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh copy
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    Then you need to run the following command:

    ```sh copy
    brew install dashlane/tap/dashlane-cli
    ```
    </Tab>

    First you need to download or git clone this repository and run the following commands in the root directory of the repository.

    Install the dependencies:

    ```sh copy
    yarn
    ```

    In order to build:

    <Tab>
    Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/Dashlane/dashlane-cli/releases) and download the latest version of the CLI for your platform.

    Move the executable binary to the bin folder of your choice and add it to your PATH.

    You may need to mark the binary as executable:

    ```sh copy
    chmod +x dcli-macos
    ```

    On macos, you may also need to allow the binary to run in your security settings. To do so, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and click on "Allow Anyway" next to the message "dcli-macos was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer".
