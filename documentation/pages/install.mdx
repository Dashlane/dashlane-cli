# Install

The Dashlane CLI can be installed in multiple ways.

You can either install it using :

-   [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on **macOS** and **Linux**
-   download the packaged executables for **Windows**, **macOS** and **Linux** on x64 architectures.
-   manually with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

    You can install the Dashlane CLI using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager for __macOS__ and __Linux__.
    
    To install Homebrew, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh copy
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    Then you need to run the following command:

    ```sh copy
    brew install dashlane/tap/dashlane-cli
    ```

    The CLI is now installed on your machine, it will be updated automatically when a new version is released.

    Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/Dashlane/dashlane-cli/releases) and download the latest version of the CLI for your platform (Windows, macOS or Linux).

    You may need to mark the binary as executable (on macOS and Linux):

    ```sh copy
    chmod +x dcli-macos-x64
    ```

    You can now try to run the CLI from the current directory in a terminal (Shell, PowerShell, etc.):

    ```sh copy
    ./dcli-macos-x64
    ```

    Move the executable binary to the bin folder of your choice, for instance:

    ```sh
    # On macOS:
    mv dcli-macos-x64 /usr/local/bin/dcli

    # On Linux:
    mv dcli-linux-x64 /usr/local/bin/dcli

    # On Windows:
    move dcli-win-x64.exe C:\Windows\System32\dcli.exe
    ```

    On macOS, you may also need to allow the binary to run in your security settings.
    To do so, go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General` and click on "Allow Anyway" next to the message "dcli-macos was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer".

    You will need to get the latest version of the CLI manually by downloading the latest release and replacing the binary in your bin folder.
