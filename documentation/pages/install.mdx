    Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/Dashlane/dashlane-cli/releases) and download the latest version of the CLI for your platform.

    Move the executable binary to the bin folder of your choice and add it to your PATH.

    You may need to mark the binary as executable:

    ```sh copy
    chmod +x dcli-macos
    ```

    On macos, you may also need to allow the binary to run in your security settings. To do so, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and click on "Allow Anyway" next to the message "dcli-macos was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer".
