# Get started with Business Commands

Commands related to business use a different authentication than your personal vault.

Commands are calling a server API to perform actions and retrieve data. The first step is to login with the personal account ([follow this guide](/personal/authentication)) of a team admin and to generate a set of credentials.

## Generate credentials

```sh
dcli t generate-credentials
```

You will be prompted with a list of variables to export in your environment.

```sh
export DASHLANE_TEAM_UUID=08a48d4f-[..redacted..]-fba9193d968c
export DASHLANE_TEAM_ACCESS_KEY=f56[..redacted..]56ce
export DASHLANE_TEAM_SECRET_KEY=839c9[..redacted..]3ada5
```

## Revoke credentials

```sh
dcli t revoke-credentials <DASHLANE_TEAM_ACCESS_KEY>
```
