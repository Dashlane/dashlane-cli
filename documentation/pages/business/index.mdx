# Get started with Business Commands

Commands related to business use a different authentication than your personal vault.

Commands are calling a server API to perform actions and retrieve data.
The first step is to login with the personal account ([follow this guide](../personal/authentication.mdx)) of a team admin and to generate a set of credentials.

## Generate credentials

<Callout>Needs to be authenticated as an admin to use this command.</Callout>

```sh copy
dcli t credentials generate
```

You will be prompted with a list of variables to export in your environment. Simply copy/paste them in your terminal.

```sh copy
export DASHLANE_TEAM_DEVICE_KEYS=dlt_[deviceAccessKey]_[payload]
```

On Windows, you can use the `set` command instead of `export`.

```sh copy
set DASHLANE_TEAM_DEVICE_KEYS=dlt_[deviceAccessKey]_[payload]
```

Make sure you save them in a safe place (use a secure note for instance ðŸ˜‰).

<Callout type="info">The token you'll get is starting by `dlt` in order to be easily identified by scanning tools.</Callout>

## List credentials

<Callout>Needs to be authenticated as an admin to use this command.</Callout>

```sh copy
dcli t credentials list
```

## Revoke credentials

<Callout>Needs to be authenticated as an admin to use this command.</Callout>

```sh copy
dcli t credentials revoke <DASHLANE_TEAM_ACCESS_KEY>
```
