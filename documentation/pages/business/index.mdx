# Get started with Business Commands

Commands related to business use a different authentication than your personal vault.

Commands are calling a server API to perform actions and retrieve data.
The first step is to login with the personal account ([follow this guide](../personal/authentication.mdx)) of a team admin and to generate a set of credentials.

## Generate credentials

<AdminFeatureBanner />

You will first need to access the Dashlane Admin Console. From there, navigate to Integrations > [Developer Access](https://universal.dashlane.com/developer-access) page to generate your CLI key with the desired scope(s) and expiration date (of maximum 12 months).

After generating the key, you will receive a variable to export in your environment. Simply copy/paste it in your terminal.

On **Linux / MacOS**, use the following:
```sh copy
export DASHLANE_ENROLLED_TEAM_DEVICE_KEYS='XXX'
```

---

On **Windows**, you can use:

```powershell copy
$env:DASHLANE_ENROLLED_TEAM_DEVICE_KEYS='XXX'
```

You can ensure that the variable is correctly set by running:

```powershell copy
Get-ChildItem Env:
```

---

Make sure you save the generated secret in a safe place (use a secure note for instance ðŸ˜‰).

<Callout type="info">
    The token you'll get is starting by `DASH_EDWSA_` in order to be easily identified by scanning tools.
</Callout>

## List credentials

<AdminFeatureBanner />

Go to the [Developer Access](https://universal.dashlane.com/developer-access) page in the Admin Console to see the list of credentials created across your organization.

## Revoke credentials

<AdminFeatureBanner />

From the [Developer Access](https://universal.dashlane.com/developer-access) page in the Admin Console, you can easily revoke any previously generated credentials.
