# Listing members

Listing team members allows you to access many information about them, such as their email, their role, their 2FA status, their security score, etc.

```sh
dcli t members
```

You can even pipe the output to `jq` to filter the results:

```sh
dcli t members | jq '.members[] | select(.isTeamCaptain == true)'
```
