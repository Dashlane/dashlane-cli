# Listing members

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">Needs team credentials to use this command.</Callout>

## Fetching the list of members

Listing team members allows you to access many information about them, such as their email, their role, their 2FA status, their security score, etc.

```sh copy
dcli t members
```

## Filtering the list of members

You can pipe the output to `jq` to filter the results:

```sh copy
dcli t members | jq '.members[] | select(.isTeamCaptain == true)'
```

## Exporting the list as a CSV

You can use the `--csv` flag to export the list as a CSV file:

```sh copy
dcli t members --csv > members.csv
```

This allows you to open the file in a spreadsheet editor such as Excel or Google Sheets.
