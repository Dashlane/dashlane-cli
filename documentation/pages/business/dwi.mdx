# Dark Web Insights Reports

<TeamCredentialsBanner />

Dark Web Insights can identify vulnerabilities across all employees in an organization, even employees who don't have a Dashlane account yet.
It does this by monitoring the dark web for employee email addresses to find domain-wide breaches and by scanning the web for any compromised organization information.

You can read more about Dark Web Insights [here](https://support.dashlane.com/hc/en-us/articles/5015658490514-Secure-compromised-accounts-in-your-organization-with-Dark-Web-Insights).

## Fetch reports

The following command fetches the latest report from Dark Web Insights for a given domain you have previously configured and verified in your admin console:

```sh copy
dcli t dwi your-domain.com
```

## Sort and paginate reports

You can sort and paginate the reports using the `--order-by` and `--count` options.

The `--order-by` option accepts the following values: `DEFAULT`, `UNSEEN`, `TEAM_MEMBERS`, `PUBLISH_DATE`.

The `--count` option specifies the number of leaks to fetch. The default value is 100.
You can also use the `--offset` option to skip a certain number of leaks.

```sh copy
dcli t dwi your-domain.com --order-by=PUBLISH_DATE --count=10 --offset=0
```
